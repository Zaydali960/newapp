          When you take a loan from Akhuwat, it should also have a mechanism to check your loan status so that you know how many installments you have paid 
          and how much is left. This feature was recently introduced by the Akhuwat Foundation on their official website, where users can know the status of 
          their loan by entering their ID card number and mobile number/file number.
